# My Small Projects

In this repository, I will put the small projects that I did for others or myself. These projects are not big enough to be placed in a separate repository, that's why I put them here.

## My goals for share projects

- knowledge transfer
- Documentation

## Projects

### Mathematics problem about "New ways to multiply 3 Ã— 3-matrices"
It solves part of a math problem. We have 3 matrices in each line. We have to find cells that have special mathematical conditions. Then put half of the cells found in 21 lines of these matrices as 0.

Please see [this link](mathematics_matrix_AlphaBetaGama) for more information and source code.

### Counter Of Matrix Zeros
We have a large number of files in which there are 69, 3x3 matrices in each file. We want to know how many files contain 0 in each cell of these matrices.

Please see [this link](CounterOfMatrixZeros) for more information and source code.
