This repository contains small projects that I developed for personal use or to assist others. These projects are not extensive enough to warrant their own repositories, so they are grouped here for simplicity.

## Projects

### 1. Mathematics Problem: *New Ways to Multiply 3 × 3 Matrices*

This project addresses a mathematical challenge involving 3×3 matrices. The task is to identify specific cells based on unique mathematical conditions. After identifying the cells, half of them are set to zero in 21 lines of the matrices.

For more details and source code, check out [Mathematics Problem](mathematics_matrix_AlphaBetaGama).

### 2. Matrix Zero Counter

This project processes a large dataset of files, each containing 69 instances of 3×3 matrices. The objective is to determine how many files contain zeros in every cell of the matrices.

For more information and source code, refer to [Matrix Zero Counter](CounterOfMatrixZeros).

### 3. WordPress Plugin: *Word Counter*

A WordPress plugin that enhances posts with the following features:
- Displays the number of words and characters in the post.
- Estimates the reading time for the content.

These details can be configured via a settings page, including:
- Choosing whether to display this information at the beginning or end of the post.
- Customizing which details to show.

The data is stored in the WordPress database.

> **Note:** This project was developed as a practice exercise.
